# Project-1---Learning-Kana
- a memory game to help you learn Japanese vowels in hiragana and katakana
- user stories
  - the game will open with a picture of a chalkboard that has the 5 English vowels and their corresponding parts in hiragana and         katakana. There will also be some text "ready to test your memory?" and a button "ready!"
  - once the user presses the button the chalk board disappears and is replaced by 15 cards
  - 5 of the cards are lined up horizontally on the top and then the ten cards are underneath the top five in horizontal rows
  - the player will first click on a card in the top row, which contains the english vowels
  - after they turn over an english vowel they will click on the lower cards turning over as many as they wish until they think they        have found a match to the english vowel in both hiragana and katakana.
  - once they think they have found the correct cards the will press the "match" button and if they are correct a message will display      "That's a match. Great job!" and if they are incorrect "That's not quite right. Try again!"
  - once all cards are matched a message will display " Amazing! you now know your Japanese vowels!"
